One way using QGIS is:

Open Python QGIS Console And:

import pip
pip.main(['install', 'Openpyxl'])
or in a cmd:

pip install openpyxl





From within the Qgis 2.18.28 's python 2.7.14 console, this works for me. It avoids having to use prompts with absolute python paths.

import subprocess
subprocess.check_call(['python', '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'openpyxl'])


The simple way I found to install libraries for Python in QGIS is

Open OSGeo4W Shell as an administrator

Type py3_env in the console (This should print paths of your QGIS Python installation)

Type python -m pip install {your library}

and its done.
